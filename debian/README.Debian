libapache2-modsecurity3 for Debian
---------------------------------

The ModSecurity-apache connector is the connection point between Apache
and libmodsecurity (ModSecurity v3). Said another way, this project
provides a communication channel between Apache and libmodsecurity.

This connector is required to use LibModSecurity with Apache.
